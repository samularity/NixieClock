# NixieClock
We (exco, kist, makefu and me) try to create a modular opensource nixie clock
The clock is based on a atmega32u4, there will be a rtc chip for good time accuray
There will be a optional esp8266 to get the time from the internet.

There will be three types of Modules
- HV Supply Module (contains max1771 stepup for generating)
- Controller Module
- Nixie Module
